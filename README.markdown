# Secure Synchronous and Asynchronous HTTP Client #

This is a Clojure wrapper around the Apache Foundation's HTTP client. It 
supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP connections, as well as X509
client certificates.

For information on using the standard synchronous HTTP client, see:

For information on using the standard synchronous HTTP client with X509
client certificates, see:

<https://github.com/diamondap/clj-apache-http/blob/master/README_X509.markdown>

For information on using the asynchronous client, with or without X509 
certificates, see:
